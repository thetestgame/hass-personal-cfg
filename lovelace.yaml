#
# This configuration file sets up the Lovelace UI for Home Assistant in YAML mode.
#
# Resources Section:
# - Loads custom resources (JavaScript modules) from the www folder, which maps to the /local/ web directory on Home Assistant's web server.
# - These resources are typically installed via the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS).
#
# Dashboards Section:
# - Defines custom dashboards for different devices (e.g., desktop and mobile).
# - Each dashboard has its own configuration, including mode, title, icon, visibility in the sidebar, filename, and admin requirements.

# Load our custom resources from the www folder.
# Most of these were installed with HACS.
#
# Note: www maps to the /local/ web directory on Home Assistant's web server. So if you have a file in www called
# /www/community/atomic_calendar-revive/atomic-calendar-revieve.js, you would reference it in the resources section
# like so: /local/community/atomic_calendar-revive/atomic-calendar-revieve.js
