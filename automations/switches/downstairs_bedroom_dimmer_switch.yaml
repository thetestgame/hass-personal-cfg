# This YAML configuration file defines an automation for a dimmer switch located in the downstairs bedroom.
# 
# The automation uses a blueprint located at 'thetestgame/hue-remote-dimmer-december-2021.yaml' and maps specific actions to the dimmer switch buttons.
# 
# The following actions are configured:
# 
# - The primary on/off buttons are mapped to control the lights in Jordan's room:
#   - Short press on the "on" button turns on the lights in Jordan's room.
#   - Short press on the "off" button turns off the lights in Jordan's room.
# 
# - The brightness up and down buttons are mapped to control the lights in the adjacent office:
#   - Short press on the "brightness up" button turns on the lights in the office.
#   - Short press on the "brightness down" button turns off the lights in the office.
# 
# The dimmer switch device is identified by the ID '878d3cee8093dcd710d9ddc0855b2579'.
